# :heart: React + Tailwind CSS + Glassmorphism

This project uses Tailwind CSS to design a glassmorphism based portfolio website.

## :astonished: What is Tailwind CSS And Glassmorphism?

- **Tailwind CSS**

  Is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in the markup.

- **Glassmorphism**

  That's a UI trend that has been steadily growing in popularity over the last year. The general idea is to have a background-blur on an object, giving the impression of a frosted glass, but the premise of this style isn't new in itself. It has been used in Windows VISTA, iOS 7 and many other styles.
